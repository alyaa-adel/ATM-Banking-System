# ATM-Banking-System
This project is a simple ATM simulation built in C that mimics the core functionality of an automated teller machine (ATM). The system allows users to securely log in, check their balance, make deposits and withdrawals, view transaction history, and change their password.

The project uses a Hill Cipher for encrypting and decrypting passwords, ensuring secure authentication. User data and transaction records are managed using linked lists, and data is persisted in CSV files to maintain state across sessions.

The application provides a basic ATM interface where users can:

Log in with a username and encrypted password.
Check their balance and perform basic banking transactions.
View their transaction history.
Securely change their password.
Exit the ATM system while ensuring that all transactions are recorded.
This project demonstrates key concepts in data structures, encryption algorithms, and file handling
